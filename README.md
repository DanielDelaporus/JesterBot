# JesterBot
A Discord Bot to help me sort my D&amp;D campaign out.

First and foremost,

I'm hosting the bot on my own PC, so the bot might not be connected at all time.

If that's all right with you, you'll just have to click this link to import the bot to a server in which you
have the correct acces rights.

https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=715905539921674271&permissions=2048&scope=bot

If you want to host it yourself, you'll have to have acces to my Discord Bot token.

Since it isn't supposed to be used by anyone but me you'll have to contact me...(kind of a personal project)

Once you have it, just save it as "token.txt" on the root file. (The .gitignore might have given that away)
